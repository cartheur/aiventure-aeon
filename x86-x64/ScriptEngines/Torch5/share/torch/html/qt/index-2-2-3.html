<p>

Publics and protected Qt slots can be called 
using the Lua method invokation syntax.
<p>

Examples:
<pre>
       widget:setEnabled(true)
       widget:show()
</pre>
<p>

Public and protected member functions whose c++ declaration 
is marked with the Qt macro <code>Q_INVOKABLE</code> can also be invoked 
using the standard Lua syntax.
<p>

When a member function has the same name as a property,
the property takes precedence.
When overloaded member functions are exposed in this fashion,
the QtLua library makes a best effort to determine
which function should be called. It first narrows the choices
using the number of parameters. When several options remain,
it chooses one on the basis of the types of the parameters.
Member function arguments with default values are handled
by considering implicit overloaded functions.
<p>

It is always possible to work around these rules
by selecting a particular member function using its signature.
<pre>
       widget['setEnabled(bool)'](widget, true)
</pre>
<p>

Member functions exposes in this way are always invoked 
from the thread owning the Qt object. If the Lua interpreter runs 
in a different thread, a <a href="index-2-4-7.html#qtqcall">thread hopping</a> 
operation is performed for the duration of the operation.
<p>

Argument types and return values are automatically converted.
Lua strings can be specified when a <code>QByteArray</code> 
or a <code>QString</code> are expected. Lua numbers can be specified
whenever numerical types are expected.
<p>

Inheritance ensures that all methods exposed
by a class are also exposed by its subclasses.
Methods exposed by the <code>QObject</code> class,
such as <a href="index-2-3-2-2.html#qobjectdeletelater"><code>deleteLater()</code></a>,
are inherited by all Qt object classes.
