 Lua is an extension programming language designed to support general procedural programming with data description facilities. It also offers good support for object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming. Lua is intended to be used as a powerful, light-weight scripting language for any program that needs one. Lua is implemented as a library, written in <i>clean</i> C (that is, in the common subset of ANSI C and C++).   
<p>

 Being an extension language, Lua has no notion of a "main" program: it only works <i>embedded</i> in a host client, called the <i>embedding program</i> or simply the <i>host</i>. This host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of Lua code, can write and read Lua variables, and can register C functions to be called by Lua code. Through the use of C functions, Lua can be augmented to cope with a wide range of different domains, thus creating customized programming languages sharing a syntactical framework. The Lua distribution includes a sample host program called <code>lua</code>, which uses the Lua library to offer a complete, stand-alone Lua interpreter.   
<p>

 Lua is free software, and is provided as usual with no guarantees, as stated in its license. The implementation described in this manual is available at Lua's official web site, <code>www.lua.org</code>.   
<p>

 Like any other reference manual, this document is dry in places. For a discussion of the decisions behind the design of Lua, see the technical papers available at Lua's web site. For a detailed introduction to programming in Lua, see Roberto's book, <i>Programming in Lua (Second Edition)</i>.
