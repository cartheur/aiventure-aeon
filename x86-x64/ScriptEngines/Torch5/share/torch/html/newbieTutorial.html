So you are wondering how to work with Torch?
This is a little tutorial that should help get you started.
<p>

By the end of this tutorial,  you should have managed to install
 torch on your machine, and have a good understanding of how to manipulate 
vectors, matrices and tensors and how to build and train a basic neural 
network. For anything else, you should know how to access the html 
help and read about how to do it.
<p>
<h1>
 What is Torch?</h1>

<p>

Torch5 provides a Matlab-like environment for state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. It is easy to use and provides a very efficient implementation, thanks to a easy and fast scripting language (Lua) 
and a underlying C++ implementation.
You can read more about Lua <a href="LuaManual.html">here</a>.
<p>
<h1>
 Installation</h1>

<p>

First before you can do anything, you need to install Torch on your machine.
That is not described in detail here, but is instead described in
the <a href="Install.html">installation help</a>.
<p>

<p>
<h1>
 Checking your installation works and requiring packages</h1>

<p>

If you have got this far, hopefully your Torch installation works. A simple
way to make sure it does is to start Lua from the shell command line, 
and then try to start Torch:
<pre>
$ lua 
Lua 5.1.3  Copyright (C) 1994-2008 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
> require "torch"
> x = torch.Tensor()
> print(x)

[torch.Tensor with no dimension]

> 
</pre>
You might have to specify the exact path of the <code>lua</code> executable, if you have several Lua installed
on your system, or if you installed Torch in a non-standard path.
<p>

The first command <code>require "torch"</code> imports the basic classes of Torch into 
Lua, and after that they can be used.
Instead of writing this on the command line in Lua you can also ask Lua on bootup to require this package from the shell:
<pre>
$ lua -ltorch
Lua 5.1.3  Copyright (C) 1994-2008 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
> x = torch.Tensor(); print(x)

[torch.Tensor with no dimension]

</pre>
If you use Lua and Torch together all the time you might want to alias Lua
to do that directly. 
Whichever way you chose, in future examples I will assume that you have started Lua and required Torch.
<p>

In this example, we checked Torch was working by creating an empty <a href="torch/index-6.html#Tensor">Tensor</a> and printing it on the screen.
The Tensor is the main tool in Torch, and is used to represent vector, 
matrices or higher-dimensional objects (tensors).
<p>

<code>require "torch"</code> only installs the basic parts of torch (including Tensors). 
The list of all the basic Torch objects installed are described 
<a href="torch/index.html">here</a>.
However, there are several
 other <i>external</i> Torch packages that you might want to use,
for example the <a href="lab/index.html">lab</a> 
package. 
This package 
provides Matlab-like functions for linear algebra.
 We will use some of these functions in this tutorial.
To require this package you simply have to type:
<pre>
require "lab"
</pre>
<p>

click <a href="index.html">here</a>.

<h1>
 Torch basics: playing with Tensors</h1>

<p>

Ok, now we are ready to actually do something in Torch.
Lets start by constructing a vector, say a vector with 5 elements,
and filling the i-th element with value i. Here's how:
<pre>
> x=torch.Tensor(5)
> for i=1,5 do x[i]=i; end
> print(x)

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
[torch.Tensor of dimension 5] 

>
</pre>
<p>

To make a matrix (2-dimensional Tensor), one simply does something like
<code>x=torch.Tensor(5,5)</code> instead:
<pre>
x=torch.Tensor(5,5)
for i=1,5 do 
 for j=1,5 do 
   x[i][j]=math.random();
 end
end
</pre>
Another way to do the same thing as the code above is provided by the 
 <a href="lab/index.html">lab</a> package:
<pre>
require "lab"
x=lab.rand(5,5)
</pre>
The <a href="lab/index.html">lab</a> package contains a wide variety of commands 
for manipulating Tensors that follow rather closely the equivalent
Matlab commands. For example one can construct Tensors using the commands
<a href="lab/index-1-6.html#ones">ones</a>, 
<a href="lab/index-1-15.html#zeros">zeros</a>, 
<a href="lab/index-1-7.html#rand">rand</a>,
<a href="lab/index-1-8.html#randn">randn</a> and
<a href="lab/index-1-3.html#eye">eye</a>, amongst others.
<p>

Similarly, row or column-wise operations such as 
<a href="lab/index-3-10.html#sum">sum</a> and 
<a href="lab/index-3-4.html#max">max</a> are called in the same way:
<pre>
> require "lab"
> x1=lab.rand(5,5)
> x2=lab.sum(x1); 
> print(x2) 

 2.6443  1.8716  3.6316  1.5378  2.4324
[torch.Tensor of dimension 1x5]

<h1>
 Example: training a neural network</h1>

<p>

We will show now how to train a neural network using the <a href="nn/index.html">nn</a> package
available in Torch.
<p>
<h2>
 Torch basics: building a dataset using Lua tables</h2>

<p>

In general the user has the freedom to create any kind of structure he
wants for dealing with data.
<p>

For example, training a neural network in Torch is achieved easily by
performing a loop over the data, and forwarding/backwarding tensors through
the network. Then, the way the dataset is built is left to the user's creativity.
<p>

<p>

However, if you want to use some convenience classes, like
<a href="nn/index-4-1.html#StochasticGradient">StochasticGradient</a>, which basically
does the training loop for you, one has to follow the dataset
convention of these classes.
(We will discuss manual training of a network, where one does not use
these convenience classes, in a later section.)
<p>

StochasticGradient expects 
as a <code>dataset</code> an object which implements the operator
<code>dataset[index]</code> and implements the method <code>dataset:size()</code>. The <code>size()</code> methods
returns the number of examples and <code>dataset[i]</code> has to return the i-th example.
<p>

An <code>example</code> has to be an object which implements the operator <code>example[field]</code>,
where <code>field</code> often takes the value <code>1</code> (for input features) or <code>2</code> (for corresponding labels),
i.e an example is a pair of input and output objects.
The input is usually a Tensor (exception: if you use special kind of gradient modules,
like <a href="nn/index-2-6.html#TableLayers">table layers</a>). The label type depends on the criterion.
For example, the <a href="nn/index-3-5.html#MSECriterion"><code>MSECriterion</code></a> expects a Tensor, but the
<a href="nn/index-3-3.html#ClassNLLCriterion"><code>ClassNLLCriterion</code></a> expects an integer (the class).
<p>

Such a dataset is easily constructed by using Lua tables, but it could any object
as long as the required operators/methods are implemented.
<p>

Here is an example of making a dataset for an XOR type problem:
<pre>
require "lab"
dataset={};
function dataset:size() return 100 end -- 100 examples
for i=1,dataset:size() do 
	local input= lab.randn(2);     --normally distributed example in 2d
	local output= torch.Tensor(1);
	if input[1]*input[2]>0 then    --calculate label for XOR function
		output[1]=-1;
	else
		output[1]=1;
	end
	dataset[i] = {input, output};
end
</pre>
<p>
<h2>
 Torch basics: building a neural network</h2>

<p>

To train a neural network we first need some data.  We can use the XOR data
we just generated in the section before.  Now all that remains is to define
our network architecture, and train it.
<p>

To use Neural Networks in Torch you have to require the 
<a href="nn/index.html">nn</a> package. 
A classical feed-forward network is created with the <code>Sequential</code> object:
<pre>
require "nn"
mlp=nn.Sequential();  -- make a multi-layer perceptron
</pre>
<p>

To build the layers of the network, you simply add the Torch objects 
corresponding to those layers to the <i>mlp</i> variable created above.
<p>

The two basic objects you might be interested in first are the 
<a href="nn/index-2-3-1.html#Linear">Linear</a> and 
<a href="nn/index-2-4-8.html#Tanh">Tanh</a> layers.
The Linear layer is created with two parameters: the number of input
dimensions, and the number of output dimensions. 
So making a classical feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer with 
 <i>HUs</i> hidden units is as follows:
<pre>
require "nn"
mlp=nn.Sequential();  -- make a multi-layer perceptron
inputs=2; outputs=1; HUs=20;
mlp:add(nn.Linear(inputs,HUs))
mlp:add(nn.Tanh())
mlp:add(nn.Linear(HUs,outputs))
</pre>
<p>

<p>
<h2>
 Torch basics: training a neural network</h2>

<p>

Now we're ready to train.
This is done with the following code:
<pre>
criterion = nn.MSECriterion()  
trainer = nn.StochasticGradient(mlp, criterion)
trainer.learningRate = 0.01
trainer:train(dataset)
</pre>
<p>

You should see printed on the screen something like this:
<pre>
# StochasticGradient: training
# current error = 0.94550937745458
# current error = 0.83996744568527
# current error = 0.70880093908742
# current error = 0.58663679932706
# current error = 0.49190661630473
[..snip..]
# current error = 0.34533844015756
# current error = 0.344305927029
# current error = 0.34321901952818
# current error = 0.34206793525954
# StochasticGradient: you have reached the maximum number of iterations
</pre>
<p>

Some other options of the <i>trainer</i> you might be interested in are for example:
<pre>
trainer.maxIteration = 10
trainer.shuffleIndices = false
</pre>
See the nn package description of the
 <a href="nn/index-4-1.html#StochasticGradient">StochasticGradient</a> object
 for more details.
<p>

<p>
<h2>
 Torch basics: testing your neural network</h2>

<p>

To test your network on a single example you can do this:
<pre>
x=torch.Tensor(2);   -- create a test example Tensor
x[1]=0.5; x[2]=-0.5; -- set its values
pred=mlp:forward(x)  -- get the prediction of the mlp 
print(pred)          -- print it 
</pre>
<p>

You should see that your network has learned XOR:
<pre>
> x=torch.Tensor(2); x[1]=0.5; x[2]=0.5; print(mlp:forward(x))
-0.5886
[torch.Tensor of dimension 1]

> x=torch.Tensor(2); x[1]=-0.5; x[2]=0.5; print(mlp:forward(x))
 0.9261
[torch.Tensor of dimension 1]

> x=torch.Tensor(2); x[1]=0.5; x[2]=-0.5; print(mlp:forward(x))
 0.7913
[torch.Tensor of dimension 1]

> x=torch.Tensor(2); x[1]=-0.5; x[2]=-0.5; print(mlp:forward(x))
-0.5576
[torch.Tensor of dimension 1]
</pre>
<p>
<h2>
 Manual Training of a Neural Network</h2>

<p>

Instead of using the <a href="nn/index-4-1.html#StochasticGradient">StochasticGradient</a> class
you can directly make the forward and backward calls on the network yourself.
This gives you greater flexibility.
In the following code example we create the same XOR data on the fly
and train each example online.
<p>

<pre>
require "lab"
criterion = nn.MSECriterion()  
mlp=nn.Sequential();  -- make a multi-layer perceptron
inputs=2; outputs=1; HUs=20;
mlp:add(nn.Linear(inputs,HUs))
mlp:add(nn.Tanh())
mlp:add(nn.Linear(HUs,outputs))

for i = 1,2500 do
  -- random sample
  local input= lab.randn(2);     -- normally distributed example in 2d
  local output= torch.Tensor(1);
  if input[1]*input[2] > 0 then  -- calculate label for XOR function
    output[1] = -1
  else
    output[1] = 1
  end

  -- feed it to the neural network and the criterion
  prediction = mlp:forward(input)
  criterion:forward(prediction, output)

  -- train over this example in 3 steps

  -- (1) zero the accumulation of the gradients
  mlp:zeroGradParameters()

  -- (2) accumulate gradients
  criterion_gradient = criterion:backward(prediction, output)
  mlp:backward(input, criterion_gradient)

  -- (3) update parameters with a 0.01 learning rate
  mlp:updateParameters(0.01)
end
</pre>
<p>

Super!
<p>
